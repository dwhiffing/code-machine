allow selecting levels during run time

should switch not be toggled by magnet until the next phase? double check flip flop in slo mo to see if its right

allow custom labels/keys

make a level with many gate examples

make adding machine

make groups
  use hotkey to group/ungroup selected stuff
  when its a group, clicking any node selects all of them

ensure that clones start from mouse position
when checking power, check one wire/node getting powered at a time?
power flow animation for wires


done
  add mode toggle
  make switches work
  make power flow work
  make relay
    add magnet: when connected as input to switch, overrides switch value with its own input
    relay is a magnet connected to a switch
  add camera controls
  add box selection
  allow dragging multiple objects
  allow copying and pasting
